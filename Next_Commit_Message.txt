Updated graph to only require Note State Matrix at input

- took the author's NoteStateInput Form function out of the process, and replaced it with tensorflow graph.  
- This made it easier to handle single time step batches required for music generation.  Also makes us less reliant on outside code.
- able to train model, save parameters, generate music, and save output 'Note State Matrix'.
