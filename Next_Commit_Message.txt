Note Generation and Loss Function Modification

- output of final LSTM goes into fully-connected layer which outputs 2 'logits' units
- sample generated from bernoulli distribution
- the articulation term being fed back is now the masked version.
- loss function uses sigmoid_cross_entropy
- loss function now also outputs log likelihood of single time step.
