Rough Training Functionality

- modified training graph to use dual binary values (i.e. [0,0], [0,1], [1,0])
- each training batch is drawn from the list of imported .midi files using getPieceBatch
- able to get loss function to decrease
- due to author's method of preprocessing, our way of handling single-timestep batches is temporarily broken.  
- This can be fixed by only using the Note State Matrix from the author's function and go back to using our graph function to generate the 80 element vector
